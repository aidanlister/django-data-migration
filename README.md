django-data-migration
=====================

`django-data-migration` is a reusable Django app that migrates your legacy data
into your new django app. The only thing you have to supply is an appropriate
SQL query that transforms your data fromthe old schema into your model
structure. Dependencies between these migrations will be resolved
automatically. Give it a try!
